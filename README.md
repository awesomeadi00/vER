## 🧠 About the Project

Surgical procedures often trigger preoperative anxiety. While having a real-life companion helps reduce emotional distress, not everyone has someone by their side. This project investigates whether **virtual companionship** through VR can provide similar comfort.

We designed a Unity-based simulation using Oculus Quest 2 where participants are placed in a virtual hospital waiting room, with or without human companions, and await a pre-surgery briefing by a doctor. Heart rate (via Arduino pulse sensor) and self-reported survey data are collected to assess stress and comfort.
